How to Get it Running
==================
If you'd like to see the proccess of how to get this up and running, feel free to watch this video: [CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/-EICFla-5Uc)

 The most logical thing to do would be to fork this GitHub repository and [enable **GH Pages**](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) since this is a static project.
If you aren't comfortable hosting on GitHub, you can also [remix the project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/willm-pass) on **Glitch**.

The site is available to test live on [https://willm-pass.glitch.me](https://willm-pass.glitch.me)! ðŸ™‚
